# Web is hard, reARMSEC aka ARMSec 2020



At this year's Armsec seventh annual information security conference - [reARMSEC](https://armsec.org), I made a small presentation ([Google slides](https://go.xss.am/armsec2020), [PDF version](https://go.xss.am/armsec2020.pdf)) on why the modern web is hard describing [HackerOne's top 10](https://www.hackerone.com/top-ten-vulnerabilities) most impactful and rewarded vulnerability types for 2020. As for the real-life examples of the bugs, I gathered reports mostly from [HackerOne's Hacktivity](https://hackerone.com/hacktivity).
